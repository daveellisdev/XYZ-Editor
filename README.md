XYZ Editor

Created for a friend. A tool to edit co-ordinates in a specific type of file easily. Searches through the inputted text for co-ordinates, edits them, and outputs the whole text with the new co-ordinates. 

Use the Test button for an example text block to use.

X, Y, Z purposely in the incorrect order on the page due to the way the file is formatted.
